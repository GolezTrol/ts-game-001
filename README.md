Learning Typescript, amongst other things

Trying to make a [TIC80](https://tic80.com/) game.

TIC80 is a virtual tiny game console, in which you can write games using a limited set of JavaScript.

So far I have

- Created a default TIC80 cartridge file.
- Fetched and installed [tic80-typescript](https://github.com/scambier/tic80-typescript), which should allow me to write typescript, and embed it as JavaScript in my TIC80 'cartridge' file.
- Installed the [F5 Anything extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=discretegames.f5anything)
- Made a launch config to compile and run config with F5.
