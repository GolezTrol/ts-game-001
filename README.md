Learning Typescript, amongst other things

Trying to make a [TIC80](https://tic80.com/) game.

TIC80 is a virtual tiny game console, in which you can write games using a limited set of JavaScript.

Read my diary [diary](./diary/README.md), especially the bottom entries, for things I did to use Typescript for TIC.
